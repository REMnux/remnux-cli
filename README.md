# REMnux Installer

> This [REMnux](https://REMnux.org) installer is no longer in use. It has been replaced with a new installation script that uses [Cast](https://github.com/ekristen/cast) as the mechanism for installing REMnux. See the [new installation script](https://github.com/REMnux/distro/blob/master/files/remnux-installer.sh) for the current approach. For installation instructions, visit [docs.remnux.org](https://docs.remnux.org).

This repository contains the source code for the now-retired REMnux installer, which is the command-line tool for installing and upgrading the REMnux distro.
